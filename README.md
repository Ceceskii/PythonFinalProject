# CNE 330 Final Project

##### Making Python do something!

# Let's make Python randomly generated passwords!

#### We will use a Python script will be used to produce an 8-character random password. 
An entirely new password will be generated at random each time the program is launched. 
Passwords will indeed be produced that are 8 characters long and contain the following characters in any order.

* 2 uppercase letters from A to Z,
* 2 lowercase letters from a to z,
* 2 digits from 0 to 9,
* 2 punctuation signs such as !, ?, “, # etc.
